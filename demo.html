        <!-- Slide 1: Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h1>Edge Computing & Object Detection Demo</h1>
        </section>
        
        <!-- Slide 2: What is Edge Computing? -->
        <section>
            <h2>What is Edge Computing?</h2>
            <p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 3: Benefits of Edge Computing -->
        <section>
            <h2>Benefits of Edge Computing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced latency</li>
                <li>Decreased data transport costs</li>
                <li>Increased privacy and security</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 4: The Demo - Real-time Object Detection -->
        <section>
            <h2>Real-time Object Detection Demo</h2>
            <p>This demo performs real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model, allowing to collect images of specific objects from your webcam and store them for later use.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 5: The Models - TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Models - TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD</h2>
            <p>TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying ML models in the browser and on Node.js. COCO-SSD is a commonly used pre-trained object detection model that can identify multiple objects in an image.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 6: Conclusion -->
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>With edge computing and efficient models like COCO-SSD, we can create powerful applications that make the most of the resources available to them, improving user experience, saving costs, and protecting privacy.</p>
